# 2048-game
It should work as follows-:

You can keep the tiles fixed to 4x4. Initially, in any random two spots, either two 2's should appear or one 2 and one 4. The moment the user presses the up arrow key, the tiles should move up, and any same tiles should add up. Same for all other directions. You can ask the user to either end the game when 2048 comes up, or keep going.
